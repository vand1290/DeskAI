The built executable will be located in `src-tauri/target/release/`.

## Offline Usage
Models are referenced by name (e.g., `qwen2.5:7b`), but loading and inference are user-provided via local runners. The provided agents are deterministic stubs by default; you can plug in your local model runners later.

### Integrating Local Models
To connect your own local models:
1. Edit `src/agents.ts`
2. Replace the stub `invoke` methods with calls to your local model runtime (e.g., Ollama, llama.cpp, etc.)

### Creating Workflows

1. Navigate to the "Workflows" tab
2. Click "Create New Workflow"
3. Enter a name and description
4. Add workflow steps by selecting from available tools:
   - **Scan**: Document scanner (placeholder)
   - **OCR**: Text extraction from images (placeholder)
   - **Summarize**: Text summarization (placeholder)
   - **Save**: File saver (placeholder)
5. Reorder steps using the up/down arrows
6. Add tags for organization
7. Save the workflow

### Executing Workflows

1. Go to the Workflows tab
2. Click the "Execute Workflow" button on any workflow
3. View execution results showing:
   - Success/failure status
   - Execution duration
   - Step-by-step results
4. Edit workflows anytime by clicking the edit (âœŽ) button

### Managing Workflows

- **Edit**: Click the pencil icon to modify workflow steps
- **Delete**: Click the trash icon to remove a workflow
- **Filter**: Use tags to find specific workflows
- **Execute**: Run workflows directly from the list view

### Viewing Analytics

### Meta-Agent Router
The system uses a deterministic keyword-based router that directs queries to specialized agents:
- **General Agent**: Default agent for general queries
- **Code Agent**: Specialized for programming and debugging tasks
- **Data Agent**: Focused on data analysis and visualization

### Using Learning Mode

1. Navigate to the "Learning" tab in the navigation
2. Enable or disable learning mode with the toggle
3. View learning statistics showing tracked actions, tools, workflows, and topics
4. Click "View Detailed Data" to see:
   - Tool usage patterns with frequency counts
   - Common workflow sequences you follow
   - Frequent topics from your conversations
5. See adaptive suggestions in the Dashboard based on your patterns
6. Reset learning data anytime from the Learning Settings page

**Privacy Note**: Learning mode operates entirely locally. All pattern analysis and suggestions are generated on your device. No data is sent to any external service.

## Memory System Architecture

**Security Note**: Shell and filesystem access are restricted to the `out` directory by default.

Workflows are stored as JSON in `out/task-chains.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "name": "Workflow Name",
  "description": "What this workflow does",
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "step-id",
      "type": "scan|ocr|summarize|save|custom",
      "name": "Step Name",
      "order": 0,
      "config": {}
    }
  ],
  "createdAt": 1234567890,
  "updatedAt": 1234567890,
  "tags": ["automation", "document"]
}
```

Learning data is stored in `out/learning.json`:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "actions": [...],
  "toolUsage": {...},
  "workflows": [...],
  "frequentTopics": {...},
  "preferences": {...},
  "lastAnalyzed": 1234567890
}
```

   - Visual interface for browsing history
   - Search and filter functionality
   - Conversation detail view

6. **LearningSettings** (`ui/components/LearningSettings.tsx`)
   - Learning mode controls

## Privacy & Security

DeskAI is built with privacy as a core principle:

- âœ… **No telemetry or tracking** - We collect nothing
- âœ… **No network calls** - Everything runs locally
- âœ… **No cloud storage** - Your data stays on your device
- âœ… **User-controlled** - Delete or export anytime
- âœ… **Open source** - Audit the code yourself

For detailed security information, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Data Management

### Exporting Data

Export your conversation history:
1. Go to History view
2. Click "Export" to download as JSON
3. Or manually copy `out/conversations.json`

### Deleting Data

Remove conversations:
1. Individual: Click Ã— on any conversation
2. All: Delete the `out/conversations.json` file
3. Reset: Use the clear function (if implemented)

### Backing Up

Your conversations are stored in `out/conversations.json` and learning data in `out/learning.json`. Include these files in your backup strategy if you want to preserve your history and learned patterns.

## Learning Mode Details

### How It Works

DeskAI's learning mode analyzes your usage patterns entirely on your device:

1. **Action Tracking**: Records your interactions (messages, searches, analytics views)
2. **Pattern Detection**: Identifies frequently used tools and common workflows
3. **Topic Analysis**: Tracks conversation topics from tags
4. **Suggestion Generation**: Creates personalized recommendations based on patterns

### What Gets Tracked

- Tool usage (chat, search, analytics, filters)
- Action sequences (workflow patterns)
- Conversation topics (from tags)
- Usage frequency and timing

### What Doesn't Get Tracked

- Message content (only metadata)
- Personal information
- Any data outside the application
- Network activity (none exists)

### Privacy Guarantees

- âœ… **Local only** - All processing happens on your device
- âœ… **No cloud sync** - Data never leaves your computer
- âœ… **User controlled** - Enable/disable anytime
- âœ… **Transparent** - Review all learned data
- âœ… **Deletable** - Reset learning data completely

### Suggestions

The learning mode provides several types of suggestions:

- **Tool Suggestions**: Frequently used features
- **Workflow Suggestions**: Common action sequences
- **Topic Suggestions**: Frequent discussion areas

Each suggestion includes:
- Confidence score (High/Medium/Low)
- Usage reasoning
- Contextual information

## Future Enhancements

Planned features:
- [ ] Advanced semantic search with local embeddings
- [ ] Conversation summarization
- [ ] Multi-modal support (images, documents)
- [ ] Enhanced context extraction
- [ ] Learning from file content
- [ ] Richer analytics dashboards
- [ ] Optional encryption at rest

```

## Security Notes
- All operations are performed locally on your device
- No data is sent over the network
- File operations are restricted to the `out` directory
- All tools are allowlisted and deterministic
