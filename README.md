## Offline Usage
Models are referenced by name (e.g., `qwen2.5:7b`), but loading and inference are user-provided via local runners. The provided agents are deterministic stubs by default; you can plug in your local model runners later.

### Integrating Local Models
To connect your own local models:
1. Edit `src/agents.ts`
2. Replace the stub `invoke` methods with calls to your local model runtime (e.g., Ollama, llama.cpp, etc.)

### Creating Workflows

1. Navigate to the "Workflows" tab
2. Click "Create New Workflow"
3. Enter a name and description
4. Add workflow steps by selecting from available tools:
   - **Scan**: Document scanner (placeholder)
   - **OCR**: Text extraction from images (placeholder)
   - **Summarize**: Text summarization (placeholder)
   - **Save**: File saver (placeholder)
5. Reorder steps using the up/down arrows
6. Add tags for organization
7. Save the workflow

### Executing Workflows

1. Go to the Workflows tab
2. Click the "Execute Workflow" button on any workflow
3. View execution results showing:
   - Success/failure status
   - Execution duration
   - Step-by-step results
4. Edit workflows anytime by clicking the edit (âœŽ) button

### Managing Workflows

- **Edit**: Click the pencil icon to modify workflow steps
- **Delete**: Click the trash icon to remove a workflow
- **Filter**: Use tags to find specific workflows
- **Execute**: Run workflows directly from the list view

### Using Scan-to-Search

1. Click "Scan Document" in the navigation
2. Upload an image or scanned document (PNG, JPG, etc.)
3. Wait for OCR processing to complete
4. View extracted text and structured data (names, dates, numbers)
5. Click "Search Scans" to find information across all scanned documents
6. Use filters to search by specific data types (names, dates, keywords)
7. View full document details by clicking "View" on any search result

### Viewing Analytics

### Meta-Agent Router
The system uses a deterministic keyword-based router that directs queries to specialized agents:
- **General Agent**: Default agent for general queries
- **Code Agent**: Specialized for programming and debugging tasks
- **Data Agent**: Focused on data analysis and visualization

### Using Learning Mode

1. Navigate to the "Learning" tab in the navigation
2. Enable or disable learning mode with the toggle
3. View learning statistics showing tracked actions, tools, workflows, and topics
4. Click "View Detailed Data" to see:
   - Tool usage patterns with frequency counts
   - Common workflow sequences you follow
   - Frequent topics from your conversations
5. See adaptive suggestions in the Dashboard based on your patterns
6. Reset learning data anytime from the Learning Settings page

**Privacy Note**: Learning mode operates entirely locally. All pattern analysis and suggestions are generated on your device. No data is sent to any external service.

## Memory System Architecture

**Security Note**: Shell and filesystem access are restricted to the `out` directory by default.

Workflows are stored as JSON in `out/task-chains.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "name": "Workflow Name",
  "description": "What this workflow does",
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "step-id",
      "type": "scan|ocr|summarize|save|custom",
      "name": "Step Name",

## Privacy & Security

DeskAI is built with privacy as a core principle:

- âœ… **No telemetry or tracking** - We collect nothing
- âœ… **No network calls** - Everything runs locally
- âœ… **No cloud storage** - Your data stays on your device
- âœ… **User-controlled** - Delete or export anytime
- âœ… **Open source** - Audit the code yourself

For detailed security information, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Data Management

### Exporting Data

Export your conversation history:
1. Go to History view
2. Click "Export" to download as JSON
3. Or manually copy `out/conversations.json` and `out/scanned-documents.json`

### Deleting Data

Remove conversations or scanned documents:
1. Individual: Click Ã— on any item
2. All: Delete the `out/conversations.json` or `out/scanned-documents.json` files
3. Reset: Use the clear function (if implemented)

### Backing Up

Your data is stored in these files:
- `out/conversations.json` - Conversation history
- `out/scanned-documents.json` - Scanned documents and extracted data

Include these files in your backup strategy if you want to preserve your history.

## Future Enhancements

Planned features:
- [ ] Advanced semantic search with local embeddings
- [ ] Conversation summarization
- [x] Multi-modal support (images, documents)
- [ ] Enhanced context extraction
- [ ] Learning from file content
- [ ] Richer analytics dashboards
- [ ] Optional encryption at rest
- [ ] Import/export in multiple formats
- [x] OCR and document scanning capabilities

## Security Notes
- All operations are performed locally on your device
- No data is sent over the network
- File operations are restricted to the `out` directory
- All tools are allowlisted and deterministic
